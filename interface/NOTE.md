--Interface only contains function signature.
--All Functions must be public.
--Interface are not class, they can't be instantiate. 
--Multiple interface implementation possible.
--An interface can `extend' another interface.
--A class can extend another class as well as implement interfaces at a time.
    --extend must come first.
--An abstract class can implement interface and perform a partial implement. Then the 
extended class of abstract class must perform rest of the implementation.
